\title{Mixed stock analysis in R: getting started with the 
  \code{mixstock} package}

\section{Introduction}
The \code{mixstock} package is a set of routines
written in the \R\ language
\cite{Rmanual} for doing mixed stock
analysis using
data on markers gathered
from source populations and from one or more mixed populations.
The package was developed for
analyzing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers from
sea turtle populations, but should be applicable
to any case with discrete sources, discrete mixed
populations, and discrete markers.
(However, I do refer to sources as ``rookeries''
and markers as ``haplotypes'' throughout this document,
and you will see other echoes of its origins, e.g.
the number of markers is internally
stored as variable \code{H} and the number of sources is 
stored as \code{R}.)
The package is intended to be self-contained,
but some familiarity with \R\ or \Splus\ will
definitely be helpful.  (Some familiarity with your
computer's operating system, which is probably
Microsoft Windows, is also assumed.)
The statistical methods implemented in the
package are described in \cite{bolk+03c} and
\cite{PellMasu01}.

\textbf{This package is in the public domain (GNU General Public
License), is \textcopyright 2008 Ben Bolker and
Toshinori Okuyama,
and comes with NO WARRANTY.  Please suggest improvements to
me (Ben Bolker) at {\tt bolker@zoo.ufl.edu}.}

If you are feeling impatient and confident, turn to
``Quick Start'' (section~\ref{sec:quickstart}).

\section{Installation}
You can skip this section if you are reading this
file via the \code{vignette()} command in \R --- that
means you've already successfully installed the
package.

To get started, you will have to download and
install the \R\ package, a general-purpose
statistics and graphics package, from
CRAN (the ``Comprehensive R Archive Network'');
go to \url{http://www.r-project.org} and navigate
from there\footnote{if you are in
the US and using Windows, you can go directly to
\url{http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/}:
you will need to download a file called \code{R-x.y.z-win32.exe}
which will install \R\ for you, when executed; \code{x.y.z}
stands for the current version of \R\ \Rver\ as of \today).
Otherwise, see
\url{http://www.r-project.org/mirrors.html} for a list of alternative
``mirror sites'' closer to you and navigate through the
web pages to find a version to install (if you are not
using Unix and/or an expert, you will want to look for
a \emph{binary} version of R).}

The following installation instructions assume
you are using a ``modern'' Microsoft Windows system
(tested on 2000 and XP); it is possible to use
\R, and the \code{mixstock} package, on other
operating systems --- please contact the
authors for more information. 
(The package has been developed under Linux and runs under
Windows; most of it should run under MacOS as well, but
it is not as well supported and you will have to build
the package from sources.   To run hierarchical models using
WinBUGS, you need to have WINE set up on Linux; I'm not
sure about MacOS.)
The setup file is about 17M, and 
\R\ takes up about 40M of disk space.
If you are running an antivirus package that is configured to check
the signatures of executable files before they run, make sure you turn
it off or register the new files installed by \R\ before proceeding.
You may also have some difficulty downloading packages if you have
a firewall running on your computer --- if you have trouble,
you may want to (temporarily, at your own risk!) disable it.

Once you have downloaded and installed \R,
start the \R\ program.  The setup program
should have asked whether you want to add a shortcut
to the desktop or the Start menu: if
you didn't, you will have to search for a file
called \code{Rgui.exe}, which probably lives somewhere
like \code{Program Files\\R\\R-\Rver\\bin} depending
on what version of \R\ you are using and where
you decided to install it.
\R\ will open up a window for you with a command
prompt ({\verb+>+}), at which you can type
\R\ commands.  (Don't panic.)

You can exit \R\ by selecting \code{File/Exit} from
the menus, or by typing \code{q()} at the command prompt.
In general, if you want help on a particular command
(e.g. \code{uml}) you can type a question mark
followed by the command name (e.g. \code{?uml})

You will next need to install the \code{mixstock}
package and two other auxiliary packages, over
the WWW, from within \R\ (you will need to
maintain a connection to the internet for this
piece, although it is also possible to do
this step off-line).
Within \R, at the command prompt, type the
following commands:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
install.packages("mixstock")
install.packages("plotrix")
install.packages("coda")
install.packages("abind")
install.packages("R2WinBUGS")
@ 

In each case, answer \code{y} to whether you want to delete
the source files; you shouldn't need them again.

(If you don't have a convenient internet connection,
you can also download the .zip files corresponding
to the different packages and install them by going
to the \code{Packages} menu within R and choosing
\code{Install from local zip file}.)

\section{Loading the \code{mixstock} package and reading  in data}
Start every session with the \code{mixstock} package by
typing 
<<>>=
library(mixstock)
@ 
at the command prompt;
this loads the \code{mixstock} and auxiliary packages.

The package can read plain text data files that are separated by white
space (spaces and/or tabs) or commas.  If your data are in Microsoft
Excel, you should export them as a comma-separated (CSV) file.  If
they are in Word, save them as plain text.  The expected data format
is that each row of data represents a haplotype, each column except
the last represents samples from a particular rookery, and the last
column is the samples from the mixed population.  Each row and column
should be named; your life will be simpler if the names do not have
spaces or punctuation other than periods in them (a common \R\ convention
is to replace spaces with periods, e.g. \code{North.FL} for
"North FL").  Do not label the haplotype column; \R\ detects the
presence of column names by checking whether the first row has one
fewer item than the rest of the rows in the file.

For example, a plain text file (with
haplotype labels \code{H1} and \code{H2}
and rookery labels \code{R1}--\code{R3})
could look like this:
\begin{verbatim}
  R1 R2 R3 mix
H1 1 2 3 4
H2 3 4 5 6
\end{verbatim}
Or a comma-separated file could look like this
(note that the first line has only 4 elements while
subsequent lines have 5).
\begin{verbatim}
R1,R2,R3,mix
H1,1,2,3,4
H2,3,4,5,6
\end{verbatim}

If you have data from multiple mixed stocks, either
put those data in a separate file or run them all
together as columns of the same table (you will
get a chance to specify how many sources and how
many mixed populations there are):
\begin{verbatim}
R1,R2,R3,mix1,mix2
H1,1,2,3,4,7
H2,3,4,5,6,0
\end{verbatim}

To read in your data,
you first need to make sure that \R\ knows how to
find them.
The easiest thing to do is to use the
menu options\footnote{\code{File/Change working directory}
on Windows, \code{Misc/Change working directory} or Apple-D
on MacOS}
to move to a directory (i.e., folder) you
will use for analysis, which should contain the data
files you want to use and will contain \R's working files.
You can use the \code{getwd()} (get working directory)
command to see where you are, and
\code{list.files()} to list the files in the current
directory.
%You can also specify the whole path to the data files
%(e.g. \verb+My Documents\turtlestuff\turtledata.csv+),
%or move your data files to \R's default working directory.
Once you have changed to the appropriate directory,
you can read in your data files and assign the
data to a variable.
For example, if you had a file 
with space-separated data called
\code{mydata.dat}, you could it read it in 
by typing
<<eval=FALSE>>=
mydata = read.table("mydata.dat")
@ 
and if you
have a comma-separated file called
\code{mydata.csv} you can use
<<eval=FALSE>>=
mydata = read.csv("mydata.csv")
@ 
(You must specify the \emph{extension} of the
file --- the letters after the dot.  Sometimes
your operating system will hide that information
from you.)

If you have your own data you can read it in
now and follow along, or you can use the
\code{lahanas98raw}
data set that comes with the package
\cite{Laha+98}:
<<>>=
data(lahanas98raw)
mydata = lahanas98raw
@ 

To make sure that everything came out OK, type
the name of the variable alone at the command prompt: e.g.
<<eval=FALSE>>=
mydata
@ 
to print out the data, or
<<>>=
head(mydata)
@ 
to print out just the first few lines, as shown above.

Next, use the \code{as.mixstock.data} command
to convert your data to a form that the package can use:
<<>>=
mydata = as.mixstock.data(mydata)
@ 

Once your data are converted in this way,
you can use \code{plot(mydata)} to
produce a summary plot of the data
(Figure~\ref{fig:data1}).
\begin{figure}
<<echo=FALSE,fig=TRUE>>=
plot(mydata,mix.off=2)
@
\caption{Basic plot of turtle mtDNA haplotype data,
using \code{plot(mydata,mix.off=2)}
(\code{mix.off=2} leaves a slightly larger space
between the rookery and mixed stock data)}
\label{fig:data1}
\end{figure}

The default plot is a barplot, with the proportions of each haplotype
sampled in each rookery represented by a separate bar; the mixed
population data are shown as the rightmost bar.\footnote{you can
change from the default colors by specifying a \code{colors=} argument:
e.g. if you have 10 haplotypes, \code{colors=topo.colors(10)} or
\code{colors=gray((0:9)/9)}. See \code{?gray} or \code{?rainbow} for
more information.}

Before proceeding, you will need to ``condense'' your data
set by (1) excluding any haplotype samples that are found only in the
mixed population (such ``singleton'' haplotypes
will break some estimation methods, and
provide no useful information on turtle origins) and (2) lumping
together all haplotypes that are found only in a single rookery and
the mixed population (distinguishing among such haplotypes provides no
extra information in our analyses, and may slow down estimation).
You can do this by typing
<<>>=
mydata = markfreq.condense(mydata)
@ 
(To examine the condensed form of the data,
you can print them by typing \verb+mydata+ at
the command prompt, \verb+head(mydata)+ to see
just the first few lines, or \verb+plot(mydata)+ to see
the graphical summary [Figure~\ref{fig:condensed}].)

Some data are already entered in the package
in the condensed format; you can access them
using the \code{data()} command.
<<>>=
data(lahanas98)
@ 
makes the haplotype frequency data from Lahanas et al. 1998
\cite{Laha+98} available as variable \code{lahanas98}, while
<<>>=
data(bolten98)
@ 
makes the loggerhead data from Bolten et al. 1998
\cite{Bolt+98} available as \code{bolten98},
already converted and condensed: \code{bolten98raw}
gives you the raw table.

\begin{figure}
<<echo=FALSE,fig=TRUE>>=
plot(lahanas98,mix.off=2,leg.space=0.4)
@
\caption{Condensed haplotype data from Lahanas 1998
(\code{plot(lahanas98, mix.off=2, leg.space=0.4)};
\code{leg.space=0.4} leaves more room
for the legend)}
\label{fig:condensed}
\end{figure}

\section{Stock analysis}
You can use the \code{mixstock} package to
run various mixed-stock analyses on your data.

\subsection{Conditional and unconditional maximum likelihood}
You can do standard conditional maximum likelihood
(CML) analysis using \verb+cml(mydata)+.
\textbf{to do: citations}
If you want to save the results, you can save them
as a variable that you can then print, plot, etc.
(Figure~\ref{fig:cml1})
<<>>=
mydata.cml = cml(mydata)
mydata.cml
@ 

Assigning the results of \code{cml} to a variable
doesn't produce any output; you need to type
the name of the variable to get the answers
to print out.

Plotting the data produces a simple plot
of the estimated contributions from each
source (with no error bars): see Figure~\ref{fig:cml1}.
<<eval=FALSE>>=
plot(mydata.cml)
@ 

\begin{figure}
<<fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=
plot(mydata.cml)
@ 
\caption{CML estimates for Lahanas 1998 data;
\code{plot(mydata.cml)}}
\label{fig:cml1}
\end{figure}
When you print CML results, \R\ will tell you there is no estimate for
the rookery frequencies, because CML assumes that the true rookery
frequencies are equal to the sample rookery frequencies, rather than
estimating the rookery frequencies independently.

The default plot for estimation results plots
points specifying the estimated
proportions of the mixed population contributed by each
rookery (to plot this with a logarithmic scale
for the vertical axis, use
\code{plot(mydata.cml,log="y")}).

Standard unconditional maximum likelihood analysis (UML)
takes a little longer, but is equally straightforward
\cite{SWT90}:

<<>>=
mydata.uml = uml(mydata)
@ 

UML estimates also include estimates of the true
haplotype frequencies in each rookery, which are
printed with the contribution estimates 
(as before, print these results by typing \code{mydata.uml} 
on a line by
itself).
As with CML, you can plot the results with
\code{plot(mydata.uml)}; by default this plot
includes just the rookery contribution
information.
You can include the estimated haplotype
frequencies in the rookeries in the graphical summary as follows:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
par(ask=TRUE)
plot(mydata.uml,plot.freqs=TRUE)
par(ask=FALSE)
@ 
(\code{par(ask=TRUE)} tells \R\ to wait
for user input between successive plots).

\subsection{Confidence intervals:
CML and UML bootstrapping}
<<eval=FALSE>>=
mydata.umlboot = genboot(mydata,"uml")
@
<<echo=FALSE>>=
if (!file.exists("umlboot.RData")) {
  t1 <- system.time(mydata.umlboot <- genboot(mydata,"uml"))
  save("t1","mydata.umlboot",file="umlboot.RData",compress=TRUE)
} else load("umlboot.RData")
@ 
will generate standard (nonparametric)
bootstrap confidence intervals for
a UML fit to \code{mydata}, by resampling
the data with replacement 1000 times (by default).
\emph{This is slow with a realistic size
data set: it took \Sexpr{round(t1[1]/60,1)}
minutes to run 1000 bootstrap samples
on my laptop.}
(You can ignore warnings about \code{singular matrix, returning
equal contribs}, \code{Error in qr.solve}, etc..)
You can find out the results by typing
<<>>=
confint(mydata.umlboot)
@ 

\begin{figure}
<<fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=
plot(mydata.umlboot)
@ 
\caption{UML estimates with bootstrap confidence limits for Lahanas 1998 data: \code{plot(mydata.umlboot)}}
\label{fig:umlboot}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation}
<<eval=FALSE>>=
mydata.mcmc = tmcmc(mydata)
@ 
<<echo=FALSE>>=
if (!file.exists("mcmc.RData")) {
  mydata.mcmc <- tmcmc(mydata)
  save("mydata.mcmc",file="mcmc.RData",compress=TRUE)
} else load("mcmc.RData")
@ 

<<>>=
mydata.mcmc
confint(mydata.mcmc)
@ 
<<eval=FALSE>>=
plot(mydata.mcmc)
@ 

do the standard things: print the results, show confidence
intervals, plot the results.
(By default the information on haplotype frequencies
in rookeries is not saved --- it tends to be voluminous ---
and so this does not show up in the MCMC results.)

\begin{figure}
<<fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=
plot(mydata.mcmc)
@ 
\caption{MCMC estimates with confidence limits for Lahanas 1998 data}
\label{fig:mcmc1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Convergence diagnostics for MCMC}

When you are running MCMC analyses, you have to check that
the Markov chains have \emph{converged} (i.e. that you've
run everything long enough for a reliable estimate).

\subsubsection{Raftery and Lewis}
The command
<<eval=FALSE>>=
diag1=calc.RL.0(mydata)
@ 
(The final character is the numeral 0, not the letter O).

<<echo=FALSE>>=
if (!file.exists("RL.RData")) {
  diag1=calc.RL.0(mydata)
  save("diag1",file="RL.RData")
} else load("RL.RData")
@ 
runs \emph{Raftery and Lewis} diagnostics on your data
set: these criteria attempt to determine how long a single chain
has to be in order for it to give ``sufficiently good''
estimates.  This function actually runs an iterative
procedure, repeating the chain until the R\&L criterion
is satisfied.

The results consist of two parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\verb+diag1$current+ gives the 
diagnostics for the last chain evaluated.
These diagnostics consist of the
predicted required length of
the ``burn-in'' period (a transient that is discarded);
the total number of iterations required; a lower bound
on the total number required; and a ``dependence factor''
that tells how much correlation  there is between subsequent
values in the chain (see \code{?raftery.diag} for more
information).  Here are the first few lines
of \verb+diag1$current+:
<<>>=
head(diag1$current)
@ 
}
\item{
\verb+diag1$suggested+ gives the history of how
long each suggested chain was as we went along:
the iterations stop once suggested $>$current,
but note that there is a lot of variability in
the results.
<<>>=
diag1$history
@ 
}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Gelman and Rubin}
The command
<<eval=FALSE>>=
diag2=calc.GR(mydata)
@ 
<<echo=FALSE>>=
if (!file.exists("GR.RData")) {
  diag2=calc.GR(mydata)
  save("diag2",file="GR.RData")
} else load("GR.RData")
@ 
tests the \emph{Gelman-Rubin} criterion, which starts multiple
chains from widely spaced starting points and tests to ensure
that the chains ``overlap'' --- i.e., that between-chain
variance is small relative to within-chain variance. 
The general rule of thumb is that the criterion should
be below 1.2 for all parameters in order for the chain
to be judged to have converged properly.
\cite{Gelm+96}.

\section{Hierarchical models}

To run hierarchical models, you will need to use either
\code{WinBUGS} (on Windows, or on Linux or MacOS via a
program called WINE, or some sort of Windows
emulator) or \code{JAGS} (a newer, less well-tested
program, but one that runs more easily on a variety of
platforms).

Brief installation instructions for these programs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \code{WinBUGS}: go to
    \url{http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/winbugs/contents.shtml}
    and follow the instructions there to download and install
    \code{WinBUGS} version 1.4 and get a license key.  
    Then make sure that you've installed the \code{R2WinBUGS} package
    (\code{install.packages("R2WinBUGS")})
  \item \code{JAGS}: go to \url{http://www-fis.iarc.fr/~martyn/software/jags/}
    and download the appropriate version for your computer. Then install 
    \code{R2jags} (\code{install.packages("R2jags",repos="http://r-forge.r-project.org")}) (\emph{hopefully \code{R2jags} will be rolled into \code{R2WinBUGS} 
      shortly, eliminating a little bit of complexity and the need to 
      download and install a development version of the package})
  \end{itemize}
    You can use the \code{pm.wbugs()} command (with the same syntax
    as \code{tmcmc} above) to run basic mixed stock analysis.
    Use \code{mm.wbugs()} to run many-to-many analyses, with
    \code{R2WinBUGS} (default, \code{pkg="WinBUGS"}) or \code{JAGS} 
    (\code{pkg="JAGS"}).

\subsection{Many-to-many analysis}

The \code{simmixstock2} command does basic simulation
of multiple-mixed-stock systems.  At its simplest,
it simply generates random uniform values for
the haplotype frequencies in each rookery
and the proportional contributions of each
rookery to each mixed stock:

<<fig=TRUE>>=
Z = simmixstock2(nsource=4,nmark=5,nmix=3,
                 sourcesize=c(4,2,1,1),
                 sourcesampsize=rep(25,4),
                 mixsampsize=rep(30,3),rseed=1001)               
Z
plot(Z)
@ 

<<echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE>>=
## hope this isn't necessary any more?
## causes warnings on CRAN
if (.Platform$OS.type=="unix") {
  WINE = system("locate wine | grep bin/wine$", intern = TRUE)[2]
  Sys.setenv(WINE=WINE)
  Sys.setenv(WINE="/home/ben/cxoffice/bin/wine") ## mine
}
@ 

Now try to fit this via \code{mm.wbugs}:
<<echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE>>=
if (!file.exists("wbugs_cache.RData")) {
  st0 <- system.time(Zfit0 <- mm.wbugs(Z,sourcesize=c(4,2,1,1),returntype="bugs"))
  st1 <- system.time(Zfit <- mm.wbugs(Z,sourcesize=c(4,2,1,1)))
  st2 <- system.time(Zfit2 <- mm.wbugs(Z,sourcesize=c(4,2,1,1),bugs.code="BB"))
  save("st0","st1","st2","Zfit","Zfit2","Zfit0",file="wbugs_cache.RData")
} else load("wbugs_cache.RData")
@ 

<<eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE>>=
## tests
st3 <- system.time(Zfit0 <- mm.wbugs(Z,sourcesize=c(4,2,1,1),
                                     bugs.code="BB",pkg="JAGS"))
Zfit2 <- mm.wbugs(Z,sourcesize=c(4,2,1,1),bugs.code="BB",n.iter=200)
Zfit3 <- mm.wbugs(Z,sourcesize=c(4,2,1,1),bugs.code="BB",n.iter=1000,pkg="JAGS")
@ 

Or, keeping the run in BUGS format for diagnostic purposes:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
Zfit0 = mm.wbugs(Z,sourcesize=c(4,2,1,1),returntype="bugs")
@ 

This takes about \Sexpr{round(st1[3]/60,1)} minutes to run with the
default settings, which run 4 chains (equal to the number of
sources) for 20,000 steps each.
(There are two different versions of the BUGS code that can
be used with \code{mm.wbugs}; in this particular case they
give relatively similar answers and take about the same amount
of time (\code{bugs.code="BB"} took \Sexpr{round(st2[3]/60,1)} minutes), 
but if you're having trouble you might try switching
from the default \code{bugs.code="TO"} to \code{bugs.code="BB"}.

Other important options when running \code{mm.wbugs} are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{n.iter}: the default is 20,000 iterations per chain, with
  the first half used as burn-in (\code{n.burnin=floor(n.iter/2)});
  this may be conservative, and could take a long time with
  realistically large data sets.  Use CODA's diagnostics as
  described above (\code{raftery.diag}, \code{gelman.diag}, etc.)
  to figure out an appropriate number of iterations.
\item \code{n.chains}: equal to the number of sources by default,
  which may again be overkill.  (\cite{Bolker+07} used three chains
  for an 11-source problem.)
\item \code{inittype}: \code{"dispersed"} starts the chains from 
  a starting point where 95\% of the contributions are assumed to
  come from a single source; \code{"random"} starts the chains from
  random starting points.  If \code{which.init} is specified, these
  sources will be used as the dominant starting points: for example,
  {\tt mm.wbugs(...,n.chains=3,inittype="dispersed",which.init=c(1,5,7))} will 
  start 3~chains with dominant contributions from sources 1, 5, and 7.  If
  \code{which.init} is unspecified and \code{n.chains} is less than the
  number of sources, dominant sources will be picked at random.
\item \code{returntype}: specifies what format to use for the answer.
  The default is a \code{mixstock.est} object that can be plotted
  or summarized like the results from any other mixed-stock analysis.
  However, for diagnostic purposes, it may be worth running the
  code initially with \code{returntype="bugs"}
  and using \code{as.mcmc.bugs} and \code{as.mixstock.est.bugs}
  to convert the result to either CODA format or mixstock
  format.  Plotting bugs format and CODA format gives different
  diagnostic plots; CODA format can also be used to run
  convergence diagnostics such as \code{raftery.diag} or
  \code{gelman.diag}.

\section{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item{read.csv/read.table + as.mixstock.data combined
into a single read.mixstock.data command? (also incorporate
hapfreq.condense as a default option)}
\item{\code{print.mixstock.est} could print sample frequencies instead of
saying ``no estimate'' for CML}
\item{MCMC section could be cleaned up considerably, explained better,
R\&L parameters not hard-coded, more efficient --- don't
re-run chains every time}
\item{incorporate rookery sizes in data}
\item{keep CODA objects or potential for CODA plots in MCMC results}
\item{make MCMC convergence process more efficient: more explanation}
\item{add hierarchical models????}
\item{describe fuzz and bounds parameters on CML/UML,
E-M algorithm}
\item{plot(...,legend=TRUE) doesn't work for CML.
add unstacked/beside=TRUE option to plot.mixstock.est}
\item incorporate source size data as part of data object
\item some functions don't work with uncondensed data: fix or issue warning
\item use \code{HPDinterval} from CODA for confidence intervals,
  rather than quantiles?
\end{itemize}
