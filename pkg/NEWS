0.9, 2008/05/14   version bump for move to r-forge

0.8.5   another plotting bug
	remove WINE/useWINE/WINEPATH from pm.wbugs, mm.wbugs, sourcesize.wbugs
	  (can be passed to bugs via ... ?)
	tweaked plot.mixstock.data (horizontal plotting now default,
	   more legend options)
	tweaked plot.mixstock.est (more options for many-to-many plots)
	added prior settings for mixed stocks in many-to-many analysis

0.8.4 identified (but didn't fix) long-file-path bug
      for R2WinBUGS
      messed with internal structure of resample,
       confint, etc. for many-to-many results.
       $resample is the sims.matrix object 
	 (flat matrix, parameters x chain);
       $resamplist is the sims.list object
	  (chain x parameter matrix)
      slight changes to summary()
      added nsource(), nmix(), nmark() to try to
	 abstract some of this info
      record timing info for R2WinBUGS runs
      tiny tweaks to C code to satisfy '-Wall -pedantic' flags

	codetools:::checkUsagePackage("mixstock")


0.8.4.1 fixed plotting bug (!)

0.8.3 small bugs in as.mixstock.est for many-to-many
        (had M and R reversed in several places)

        mixstock.data objects
      moved bugs code locators inside functions
       (LazyLoad problem)

0.8.2 fixed mixed stock labeling stuff
      tweaking many-to-many code (TO-style BUGS code)
      tiny tweak in utils.c/h to avoid sign() conflict with R
      simmixstock2 allows random start
      added stub for UML start for mm.wbugs
