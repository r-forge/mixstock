  fix summary.mixstock.est for CML
  update NEWS format to NEWS.Rd
  fix tmcmc for maxmarks
  pass level argument through plot.mixstock.estimate

  fix warnings in plotCI -- forward plotCI hack to Jim Lemon
  progress bars
  suppress warnings in boot?
  diag1 : check variability/ hack vignette
  par (ask)

- print contributions as <0.001? (with printCoefmat)
- add as.data.frame.mixstock.data
- onepage/ask flags for multi-page plots
- add flexibility to MM plots
- work on package vignette
- clean up/fix CML estimates; test UML estimates further (??)
- establish testing directory, regression tests
- many to many:
   * run various timing tests 
   * faster approach?  MCMCpack or explore
      doing Gibbs sampling in C code???
- BUGS/WinBUGS interface
- JAGS interface???
- clean up redundant simulations etc. (recreate figures from Bolker et al 2003?)
- Tcl/Tk interface? Web interface??
- fix up/test convergence testing
- add confidence intervals to turtle.est objects
     (within fit, or as a separate component)
- memory constraints with MCMC: 
    - allow/figure out thinning
    - read/write to/from files?
        - run chains, save to file: don't
              re-run for each test, etc..
             
        If file is specified, look for runs saved to file
        (as  foo.i.bot, foo.i.frq): read these, possibly
        seeking to the right point in the chain to start

      e.g. Raftery and Lewis calculation can add to file,
              starting from end point
         G & R can use these files, and add to them if necessary

          estimates can use existing files
           (objects may store resamples in file or in memory)
